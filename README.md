As you move through the day past time blocks will be displayed in Grey: Red is for the Current time block and Green is for time blocks that are still avialable. Check out the example below

notice up to 4 is grey: 4 is the current time so its red: and the last block is 5 which is green

if you have something you would like to schedule click the save button to the right and your event will be saved for later
